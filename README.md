# About Me

## This website built by :
**HTML5 , CSS , JS**

### First of all the website has many questions to makes the user interacts with it ,And _these questions about the owner of the website_ so it gives the user an ideas and more knowledge about the website's owner .

### These questions ask the user about the owner:
+  **what's the owner hobbies**
+  **where the owner lives**
+  **does he work**
+  **what's his lucky number**
+  **does he speak Arabic language**

So if there was many questions then that's mean I used many **prompts** to ask the user what I want and there were many attempts to give the user more chances to submite the correct answer and after these attempts it shows the correct answer to the user and I provided this thing by **for** statement .

In HTML file I added 2 lists order and unorder lists,One of them contains _**my education**_ and 2nd one has _**Most places that I would like to visit**_ and it has 10  .
